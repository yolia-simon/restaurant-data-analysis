# Restaurant Data Analysis Project

Developing a Python-based data system using three years of customer data to improve efficiency and service delivery. The system provides clear insights into:

* Weekly food consumption patterns <br>
  Goal: See how many meals are sold per week using a line chart. [time on the x-axis, number of orders on the x-axis]

* Peak days for vegan and mixed dishes <br>
  Goal: Compare the demand for vegan vs mixed food on each day of the week. [days of the week on the x-axis, orders on the y-axis]

* Demand distribution across delivery companies
  Goal: See which delivery company carries the most orders.

* Staffing requirements in the kitchen
  Goal: Estimate how many staff are needed at different times. [time on the x-axis, staff needed on the y-axis]

The system will also provide business statistics to quickly see top-level performance.
