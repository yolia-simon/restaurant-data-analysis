# Restaurant Data Analysis Project

Developing a Python-based data system using three years of customer data to improve efficiency and service delivery. The system provides clear insights into:

* Weekly food consumption patterns <br>
  Goal: See how many meals are sold per week using a line chart. [time on the x-axis, number of orders on the x-axis]

* Peak days for vegan and mixed dishes <br>
  Goal: 

* Demand distribution across delivery companies

* Staffing requirements in the kitchen

* Service levels needed to optimise efficiency and maximise profit
